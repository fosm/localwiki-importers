 * Usernames are case sensitive in mediawiki.  We need to normalize on
   import somehow.  Rename on import?  "MattH" and "Matth" -> "MattH" and "Matth_2" ?
 * Fix bug with templates sometimes not getting turned into includes
 * Turn categories into tags -- when we have tagging.
 * Speed up import. Threads / greenlets, or something.
